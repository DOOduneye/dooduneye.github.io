              TL;DR - a way to increase strength through increasing intensity
              <br>
              <br>
              Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed on the body during training. This can be done in several ways, but the most common is to gradually increase the weight lifted. The principle of progressive overload is that you should continually challenge your body by gradually increasing the demands you place on it. So more weight or more reps or intense lifting will cause progressive overload. This will lead to muscle growth and increased strength.

             When I say or, I mean <strong><em>or</em></strong>. You don't want to overdo progressive overload, or else it will lead to poor recovery, and you will never increase in strength or grow muscle because the muscle will be too fatigued. This can actually lead to injury if you continue to overload before recovery. Recommended to increase the weight or reps or intensity every 2 to 4 weeks. With everything proper, eating is necessary you can't get stronger without giving the body protein to digest and new muscle fibers. Also, de-loading is as important as increasing the weight, reps, or intensity. It's generally helpful to hinder overtraining but is a catalyst when you hit a plateau in progress or due to overtraining, you are sleep deprived, eating poorly, and stressed.
