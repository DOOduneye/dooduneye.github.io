              The biggest and most consistently important moment in my life was when I began to write.
              It was fueled by my loneliness and desire to be accepted by whatever community wanted me.
              I didn't write this to get pity, this is just the best medium for me to express myself.

              It began in elementary school through an activity offered by my teacher.
              She would require us to write in a notebook for 15-20 minutes at the beginning of class.
              To write about whatever came to our mind and either build upon it each day or create something new.
              This was perfect for my ADHD ridden mind. Writing about anything I wanted lead me to write about space
              aliens, and island trapped survivors, a man on a quest for a sword, and more, but somehow conceptualized
              into one long-running story. My toes were hypothetically wetted and they didn't really get much more so
              until middle school where I started reading.

              I think every kid has one book series they followed harshly&mdash;into their adulthood.
              Mine was Harry Potter. I read plenty other fantasy and science fiction books but nothing but
              the Harry Potter series seeped into my mentality. I read and finished all the book in 3-4 months and then
              moved on onto the films. It attracted me so much to the world of fiction that I wanted to create my own.
              <br>
              <br>
              I did just that, wrote a couple short things in a journal during class when I had free time, then during class
              when I didn't have free time. It was flourishing to do something that made me happy that I ignored every other
              important task. These almost meaningless beginning manuscripts lead me formulating and creating&mdash;at the
              time amazing work.

              The truly first, and most important work was <em>'The Cove'</em>. Tells the story of a billionaire who is insane enough
              to predict the end of times and prepares for it. I spent over 3 years on it and it at the time was beautiful to me.
              Though <strong>warning</strong>, grammar, punctuation, fluency of words and phrases, and general story telling techniques are missing.
              It is also 56 pages long, with a very rushed ending. It was the best of what I could do, with my time, and my ability to fixate.
              <br>
              <br>
              This was then put onto wattpad, if anyone knows what that is, I apologize. Where I wrote more stores. Another called <em>'Realms'</em>,
              that explored the adventure of a genius teen scientist when he meets his future self. Another, <em>'The Diary of the Last Man on Earth'</em>,
              which as the title says explores the diary of the last man on Earth and what happened to the world. Weirdly enough this was one of my
              favorites even though I stopped writing really early on. It had improved story telling techniques and better descriptive writing which
              is essential to setting mood and tone.

              In all, more than the writing itself and all the stories I could've told and did tell they all stemmed from the reason origin and saved
              me from a possibly horrible future. It kept me focused on school, which lead to me course correcting in high school and then becoming a
              well adjusted college student in one of the best places to go to college.

              Here are some links to my old books, don't judge them harshly. They were written by a 12 year old.
