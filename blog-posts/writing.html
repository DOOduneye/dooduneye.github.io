              The most significant and most consistently important moment in my life
              was when I began to write. It was fueled by my loneliness and desire to
              be accepted by whatever community wanted me. I didn't write this to get pity;
              this is just the best medium for me to express myself.
              <br>
              <br>
              It began in elementary school through an activity offered by my teacher.
              She would require us to write in a notebook for 15-20 minutes at the beginning of class.
              To write about whatever came to our mind and either build upon it each day or create something new.
              This was perfect for my ADHD-ridden mind. Writing about anything
              I wanted led me to write about space aliens, island-trapped survivors, a man on a quest for a sword, and more,
              but somehow conceptualized into one long-running story. My toes were hypothetically wetted,
              and they didn't get much more until middle school, when I started reading.

              I think every kid has one book series they follow harshly into adulthood.
              Mine was Harry Potter. I read plenty of other fantasy and science fiction books.
              Still, nothing but the Harry Potter series seeped into my mentality.
              I read and finished all the text in 3-4 months and then moved on to the films.
              It attracted me so much to the world of fiction that I wanted to create my own.
              <br>
              <br>
              I did just that. I wrote a couple short things in a journal during class when I had free time,
              then during the course when I didn't have free time. It was flourishing to do something that made me
              happy that I ignored every other important task. These almost meaningless beginning manuscripts lead
              me to formulate and createâ€”at the time, fantastic work.
              <br>
              <br>
              The truly first and most important work was <em>'The Cove.'</em>
              Tells the story of a billionaire who is insane enough to predict the end of times and prepares for it.
              I spent over 3 years on it, and it at the time was beautiful to me.
              Though <strong>warning</strong>, grammar, punctuation, fluency of words and phrases, and general storytelling techniques are missing.
              It is also 56 pages long, with a very rushed ending. It was the best of what I could do with my time and ability to fixate.
              <br>
              <br>
              This was then put onto Wattpad; I apologize if anyone knows what that is.
              Where I wrote more stores. Another called 'Realms' explored the adventure of a genius teen scientist when he met his future self.
              Another, 'The Diary of the Last Man on Earth,' which, as the title says, explores the diary of the last man on Earth and what happened to the world.
              This was one of my favorites, even though I stopped writing early. It had improved storytelling techniques and better descriptive writing, which is essential to setting mood and tone.

              More than the writing itself and all the stories I could've told and did tell,
              they all stemmed from the reason origin and saved me from a possibly horrible future.
              It kept me focused on school, which led to me course-correcting in high school and then
              becoming a well-adjusted college student in one of the best places to go to college.

              Here are some links to my old books, don't judge them harshly. They were written by a 12-year-old.
