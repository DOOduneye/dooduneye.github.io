            Hello! I am a undergraduate student at Northeastern as well as a novice developer.
            I would say this is a website to show off my work and skills in Computer Science
            but I would rather define this as a place to write. I've been writing for most of
            my life and I took a long hiatus to follow my other passions but a hiatus has to
            end at some point.
            <br/><br/>
            Here you'll find my projects&mdash;previous and un-coming, as well as my interests and blog.
            My blog will be an amalgamation of ideas and podcast episodes that I will be releasing
            that you may as well subscribe to on spotify here and on my RSS feed.
            <br/><br/>
            If you are interested in connecting with me I have plenty of links below that will
            allow you to do such. I'm always up to have a chat!
